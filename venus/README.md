# Mapping of the Idunn Mons Area

## Overview

The area is too large to map all of it in detail, but it does contain a variety of different features of interest, including a rift in the northwest, a corona in the southwest, various lava flows, small volcanoes and plains units in the northeast, and Idunn Mons itself in the southeast.

Quality is better than quantity: what you are trying to achieve is an understanding of the origin and history of the area of interest, which does not require a knowledge of each and every fracture or lava flow.

## Tasks

Pick one of these areas (i.e. about a quarter of the total), depending on your interests, to map at the full resolution of the image. For your area of interest:
*	Identify and locate any small volcanoes, outlining each edifice. Classify them as a group or several groups if you can identify different sets
*	Map the principal structural trends and group them into kinematic sets (i.e. sets that formed at the same time)
*	Outline any discrete units discernible in the SAR imagery (e.g. tessera)
*	Using the SAR and dielectric datasets together, distinguish different groups of surficial (sedimentary) materials and try to identify their sources or transport directions
*	Review your mapping and think about the sequence of events and geological history of your selected area

An accompanying short guide has been written to supplement the workshop tutorials.

# Venus: Radar Mapping Guidance

Radar mapping is a powerful tool for interpreting Venus’ surface features. This guide explains how radar images work and provides key considerations for mapping morphological units and structures.

## How Radar Imaging Works

Radar is an active system and what we see is backscattered energy. For the usual range of incidence angles (25° to 45°) there is more backscatter (the image is brighter) for surfaces that are sloping towards the radar (remember to check if the image is illuminated from the left or the right); surfaces that are rougher at about half the scale of the wavelength (for Magellan, an average roughness of 4 cm is smooth and 8 cm is rough); and for surfaces that have a higher relative permittivity (dielectric constant) – for Magellan this usually occurs at high altitudes.

## Sensitivity and Mapping Strategy

**Texture vs. Composition:**
  
Hence radar images are sensitive to surface texture (slope, roughness) and insensitive to composition (most rocks look the same). It is generally safer (better) to map morphological units and structures than rock units, except where particular rock types have a distinctive small-scale morphological character. For example, fresh lava flows tend to be visible because they have rubbly margins, whereas weathered flows are less visible because weathering softens the rubble. Critically, Venus plains often have a weathered or sedimentary veneer that obscures geological boundaries and cannot be regarded as a single coherent unit but as a background terra incognita.

**Structural Considerations:**

When mapping structures, particularly in topographically rough areas, particular care must be taken to understand foreshortening and layover: symmetric folds will appear to lean (verge) towards the radar (in left-looking images, they will appear tilted towards the left). This is in addition to the problem of the brightness variations caused by sloping surfaces. When mapping structures remember that the longest, straightest fractures usually formed first (dyke-induced fractures are an exception); consider the kinematic relationships between fracture sets (i.e. are there relationships consistent with the same stress field, such as conjugate pairs). This aids mapping: there are often far more fractures than can reasonably (or usefully) be mapped; instead, focus on the relationships and trends.

**Volcanic and Sedimentary Features:**

Lava flows and volcanic constructs are relatively easy to identify, but look for the relationships between them and structures radial or circumferential to them, which are often induced by dykes and can reveal both the nature of the volcanic plumbing system and the relative timing of events. Also note other associations, such as alignment along or parallel to rift systems, that may reveal both plumbing and timing: there is an intimate association between rifts, corona and volcanoes. Using the ‘magic airbrush’ technique of inverting the right-look image and averaging it with the left can be very helpful, but be wary of geometric artefacts and apparent displacements between image pairs.
Sedimentary processes are nearly always overlooked because they are subtle and can be difficult to interpret. Mass wasting is ubiquitous on slopes – but difficult to discriminate – and wind-blown (aeolian) material is prevalent across large swathes of the plains. Adding emissivity data as a colour component can help identify subtle differences between sediment sources, in addition to fresh versus weathered surfaces.

**Comparative Analysis:**

There are now easily accessible SAR images for most of the Earth, which can be compared with optical data and even ground based photography. Do make use of these to compare features on Venus with analogues on Earth, and to train your eyes to see in radar.
